The first people to pass by were some of the king\u2019s wealthiest merchants and courtiers. Rather than moving it, they simply walked around it. A few loudly blamed the King for not maintaining the roads. Not one of them tried to move the boulder \ud83d\ude33 Finally, a peasant came along. When he got near the boulder, rather than simply walking around it, the peasant tried to move the stone to the side of the road. It took a lot of effort but he finally succeeded \ud83d\ude4c The peasant was ready to go on his way when he saw a purse lying where the boulder had been. The peasant opened the purse \ud83d\udc5d The purse was stuffed full of gold coins and a note from the king \ud83c\udfc6 The king\u2019s note said the purse\u2019s gold was a reward for moving the boulder from the road. The king showed the peasant what many of us never understand: every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition \ud83d\udcaa", "Are you able to play a dvd?": "I have not learned this skill yet.
